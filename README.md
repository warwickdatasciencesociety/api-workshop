# WDSS API Workshop - Flask App - Extension

## Task
- Harden your security using JWT

## Preqrequisites
- Have Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of python
- Basic terminal knowledge or how to install/run python without a terminal
- Basic understanding of relational databases and SQL

## Harden your API security!
1. You'll see that `app.py` has been populated with some code relating to JWT (JSON Web Token). The databases now also has a new `user` table with some very securely stored credentials. There is also a provided `login.html` template which will be useful for providing a mechanism to get JWT tokens required to use the API.
2. Use the documentation provided for JWT and Flask to provide an interface to log in and get a generated JWT token, which can then be supplied in API requests.
