        "## Intro\r\n",
        "Before getting started let's cover some basic concepts. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for data to be shared between applications. It facilitates the communication through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and other operations.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Some reasons we want to use APIs are because:\r\n",
        "- We don't need access to all the data available\r\n",
        "- Some data may be rstrictired/require special privileges to access\r\n",
        "- Data is constantly being updated e.g. users tweets, stock prices\r\n",
        "- Reduce computational load on the client\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### REST\r\n",
        "REST has been the defacto standard for the past few years. You'll often hear of them described as RESTful. You communicate with REST APIs over HTTP, with the most common operations being GET (Read), PUT (Update), POST (Create), and DELETE (Delete). \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "GET is the most commonly used endpoint as in most cases (especially with public APIs), you'll just be retrieving data.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### JSON\r\n",
        "A brief intro to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is that it's just a way for us to represent data. It's built up of key-value pairs stored in objects (The ones with '{}' brackets). If we need to return multiple of the same object we can return this in an array (The ones in '[]' brackets). It's really simple to access specific elements in the JSON object if you know the structure. You just index the object like you would an array and/or dictionary.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### Status codes\r\n",
        "These are useful as they tell us what's happening with our request\r\n",

        "`200` - Ok (Success)\r\n",
